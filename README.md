# DOM Exercises at BeCode üåê

This repository contains a collection of exercises focused on mastering the **Document Object Model (DOM)**. These exercises were completed as part of my training at **BeCode** and aim to strengthen my understanding of JavaScript interactions with web page elements.

## Overview üìã

In this project, you will find:
- Exercises to learn how to manipulate the **DOM** using JavaScript.
- Examples of selecting, modifying, and responding to events on HTML elements.
- Techniques for creating interactive and dynamic web applications.
